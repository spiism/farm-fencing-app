## Architecture Overview

### The application follows a modern React architecture with the following key principles:
- **Component-based Architecture**: Modular, reusable components with clear separation of concerns
- **Redux Toolkit State Management**: Centralized state management with RTK for cart state and user preferences
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS for flexible layouts supporting all screen sizes
- **Simulated API Layer**: Realistic API simulation with configurable delays and error handling
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works as PWA with native mobile capabilities through Capacitor

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen for global state management due to excellent TypeScript support and built-in best practices
- **Capacitor Preferences**: Used for cart persistence to maintain data across app sessions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent styling
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better development experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool optimized for modern web development with HMR
- **Vitest**: Modern testing framework with excellent Vite integration

## Running the App

### Development Mode
```bash
#CurrentMonthlyBillStart development server
npm run dev

# Run on mobile device/emulator
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap run ios    # For iOS
npx cap run android # For Android
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Mobile Development
```bash
# Add platforms
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android

# Open in native IDEs
npx cap open ios
npx cap open android
```

## Testing

The application includes comprehensive unit tests covering critical functionality:
### Test Coverage

**API Layer Tests (`fetchProducts.test.ts`)**:

- âœ… Successful fetch and parsing of product data
- âœ… HTTP error response handling (500, 404, etc.)
- âœ… Network failure and fetch rejection handling
- âœ… JSON parsing error scenarios

**Component Tests (`ErrorMessage.test.tsx`)**:

- âœ… Basic rendering with required and optional props
- âœ… Conditional retry button rendering
- âœ… Click event handling and function execution
- âœ… CSS class application and styling verification
- âœ… Edge cases (long messages, empty strings, special characters)
- âœ… Accessibility compliance
- âœ… Component structure validation
### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Configuration

### API Delay Configuration

Adjust the API simulation delay inÂ `src/api/api.ts`:
```bash
const API_DELAY = 1000; // Change to desired delay in milliseconds
```

### Tailwind Configuration

The app uses Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite plugin for optimal performance and development experience.
